      question: "How fast will I see results?",
      answer: "We typically deliver the initial MVP within 2 weeks. You'll see daily progress updates and have access to our staging environment from day one."
    },
    {
      question: "Why shouldn't I just hire freelancers or build it myself?",
      answer: "Freelancers can be unreliable and managing them takes time. Building it yourself distracts from business growth. We provide a managed, senior team that delivers guaranteed results."
    },
    {
      question: "What's included in the MVP package?",
      answer: "Everything you need to launch: Full-stack development, database setup, authentication, payment integration, basic analytics, and deployment to a production environment."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens after the MVP is done?",
      answer: "We offer a seamless transition to our Growth Retainer for ongoing development, or we can hand off the code to your in-house team with full documentation."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I want the full product, not just an MVP?",
      answer: "We can scale up! Our architecture is designed to grow. We'll simply extend the roadmap and continue building features based on your prioritized backlog."
